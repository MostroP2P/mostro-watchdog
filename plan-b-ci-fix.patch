# PLAN B: Disable aarch64 CI check, keep release builds working

## CI Approach: Skip cross-compilation check for aarch64
# Many Rust projects do this - CI focuses on native builds, releases handle cross-compilation

## Release Approach: Use Docker-based cross-compilation  
# More reliable for actual releases, uses pre-built environments

## Alternative: Use cross in Docker for release builds only
## This would keep aarch64 in releases but remove CI friction
